                <p>welcome to our second episode of Carbon and Cardboard we're going to ⁓ try to take some of the ideas that we had in our first episode and and apply them to actually playing a game of Daybreak which is a pretty neat game very topical but also with some really neat game mechanics underneath it that really have surprised me, honestly.</p>
                <p>let's do our introductions again first, just so everybody knows the voices. I'm Scott Kennedy. I'm in San Francisco, California.</p>

                <p>And yeah, I didn't call that out the first time, but this is a project that we are starting as part of the Climate-Based Fellowship. So the first time we talked a lot about making board games a powerful way to communicate certain ideas relevant or adjacent to climate science.</p>
                <p>We brought in a bunch of educational theory, we talked about our own experiences, and we came up with a few things rather than expecting ideas to sort of magically just come forward while we explore this ⁓ game,</p>
                <p>let's see what happens if we focus in on one aspect</p>
                <p>Nathaniel, if you want to start us off with this idea that is larger than this game in particular, but that you felt like really showed up.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="speaker-text">
                <p>Absolutely. Daybreak is a game that is thematically about climate change. So it's very on the nose for us. one of the things I've noticed in playing Daybreak a couple of times is there's a pretty big emphasis on, there's a couple of ways you could talk about, you could say opportunity costs. You could also think in terms of the...</p>
                <p>time value of your choices.</p>
                <p>as we go about playing the game, one of the decisions we're gonna have to make over and over again is which projects make sense right now.</p>
                <p>and constantly trading off projects that might have a better short-term benefit for projects that over time might be worth more because we can do them over and over again or because they'll become more powerful over time. I do think there is one other point worth highlighting as we get ready to start the game, which I think we also talked a little bit about in our first episode.</p>
                <p>which is asymmetry. So Daybreak has a little bit of asymmetry built into the structure of the game. Each of us, the four of us have been assigned a country or region of the world that we are playing as. So I've been assigned China, Scott has been assigned Europe. I think that's Audrey is the United States and Josh is it's labeled a majority world. I think that just means everyone else.</p>
                <p>And if you notice, each of us has a different starting situation. So China has a large population that grows quickly, a certain constellation of existing emissions, a certain energy profile of mostly dirty energy, and certain resiliences that we have, a social resilience and an infrastructure resilience, but no ecological resilience. Contrast that, for example, and we also have an existing crisis, community crisis, contrast that with the United States, which is Audrey's.</p>
                <p>player, which starts out with a much smaller population that grows more slowly. Less energy overall, it's also pretty dirty, a different set of emissions, and ecological resilience and infrastructure resilience, but no social resilience. So each player has a different starting situation as well as a different growth rate. And that will be pretty important as the game continues. And this majority world you can see, you know, it's everyone else. So there's a lot of people and they're growing quickly and they have a lot of emissions.</p>
                <p>and they have a lot of crises.</p>

                <p>So we play a round of this before failing because America leaves the table, which make of that what you will. But notice before she does, Audrey, who is playing America, calls me out on a couple of decisions I make early on that probably would have cost us the game anyway,</p>

                <p>Okay, great. Let's get started then. I think the first thing that we do here is vote on the global project we want to start with, My initial take on this is that we're choosing between</p>
                <p>Solar technology at scale, this just seems like it boosts everybody once it's in place where solar will generate more electricity for us and be more effective. On the other Renewable energy, innovative partnership, basically,</p>
                <p>once this is in play, you have converted to 100 % clean energy, you can give any amount of that energy to any other one player every round. So once things get hard and they get hard in this game, we should be very clear. We probably will not win. It gets very hard and very often a lot of cooperation becomes really necessary. So,</p>
                <p>My first thought was this thing that boosts solar in general seems like it's going to be generating extra energy for us the entire time through for everybody without doing anything. It has a simplicity value and maybe a time value of actions in that as soon as it's active, it'll be active the rest of the game. On the other hand, the flexibility of the last one seems like it become a really big deal in the end game.</p>
                <p>⁓ We all now make our votes</p>

                <p>I'll vote that way. That sounds good to me. Hey, I got a quick gameplay question. The icons at the top right of the cards for our projects, those indicate a cost to</p>

                <p>The top</p>
                <p>right is the resource type that that card has with it. So each of those cards provides that resource. And then if you put more cards behind that project later on, you get all of the resources, not just from the top card, but all of the stacked cards.</p>

                <p>One of the game mechanics I found really interesting in this game is building these little machines. Many of these games you build machines, but the way that it works in this is pretty interesting to me. The way that those tags stack up,</p>
                <p>we talked about notion of succession and this is really neat because you might start to put your social resilience tokens in that stack, right? Because only the ones that are in that stack are gonna make this card more effective. So you sort of concentrate them there. if you put another card which also uses that social resilience stack, it's gonna,</p>
                <p>be a lot more powerful coming out of the gates. So this is really neat notion of technologies which essentially succeed each other in powerful ways, which I thought was pretty interesting from a lot of our, you know, energy and climate transition discussions as well, really well modeled here.</p>

                <p>So why don't we lock in our global project choice so we can start the first round. So we need each, everyone's gotta hit lock on their vote. There you go. All right, so now we've each been dealt a hand, and we can all see each other's hands in each other's projects.</p>

                <p>And one interesting thing about this game is we play at the same time and we all just keep, you keep going till you decide your turn is over. Generally that happens when you're out of cards in your hand or out of projects you can use. But kind of we can just each get to work looking at our own cards and think about what we want to do. Now we did pick that solar project and I noticed that I do have one card with solar.</p>

                <p>Yes. And at the end of each round, you need to make sure that the amount of electricity you are generating is at least as high as the number of population you have. That's total electricity. It doesn't have to be from either source, but of course dirty electricity is going to generate emissions and those are bad.</p>

                <p>that methane removal card is it's just a very expensive cost each turn to use it. So like two cards from your hand. That's just a lot. The other thing is it's a temporary, so you're removing the emissions you're removing are from your personal emissions when we calculate them each round. What we're not doing is a removing.</p>

                <p>emissions that are already out on the board some for example, if you plant trees, then every round those trees absorb emissions, whereas here, to get this benefit, you're going to have to pay two cards every round to get the benefit. that's the trade off there, you'd have to decide if it's worth it.</p>
                <p>I would focus on cutting emissions more. You've got your clean electricity plant stack. You'll get to add to that stack so it'll get faster and faster over time. I would say you probably want to focus on cutting emissions if you can, if there's a way to do it.</p>

                <p>what's happened here is we've gone up to one full rung on our thermometer and almost all but one block on the next rung. That has caused us to roll the tipping point dice and we rolled the loss of Arctic sea ice, which has meant we've reached a tipping point on Arctic sea ice. And what that does is it generates seven more, eight more units of carbon. That has in turn pushed us into the next degree.</p>

Which means unless you reduce your carbon or can do things like plant trees, you know, we're gonna have 40 units of carbon on that first turn. And we actually had 39, which is what took us</p>
                <p>one full band and almost a second band. rolled the die for that first band. We had a tipping point. It released more carbon. So now we're two bands up. So that first term is pretty catastrophic. I feel like if you're starting situation is such that you can reduce a lot of emissions on that first turn, that's really powerful. ⁓ And our starting.</p>

                <p>it's so neat. Like you can see that in the game mechanics and it is such a like reflection of things that we've we've heard about, right? Like from the project drawdown people of like, hey, I don't care if this is going to be the best technology ever in 10 years. It is worth more to do something simple to reduce emissions now because I get that 10 years of reduced emissions and you can just see that in the game mechanic.</p>

                <p>Well, yeah, to get more</p>
                <p>specific on that first round, we ended up with a net carbon of 39. Now each of these bars takes 20. So this bar filled up with the first 20 and then we had 19 on the second bar. When you fill up a bar, you have to roll the die here and you move up on one of these tracks. Some of the tracks have an immediate crisis. Some of them don't. We happened onto a track that had an immediate crisis. Tipping point, I guess they're called. And</p>
                <p>The particular tipping point we got was one that contributed carbon immediately, which meant that because we were sitting at 19 out of 20 here, that immediately pushed us into the next band, which forced us to roll that die again. So that was a particularly unlucky course of events. But if we had been able to cut our carbon by, because we cut it by one, if we'd be able to cut eight more carbon on that first round, which is achievable with four players,</p>
                <p>then the first tipping point wouldn't have pushed us over that threshold.</p>

We were generating solar. We're doing all the right things. Then she's like, yeah, check it out. In 2050, you are still in the tank. Why?

It's just built into the mechanics that all this stuff that we've been talking about and learning about. I mean, it's not shocking. They went and did their research, but it's still really interesting to see how you could come to this game not knowing or caring anything about climate. But if you wanted to play the game well, you end up having to think about the fact that you can't just build green capacity. You've got to get rid of the old dirty capacity. It's wonderful.

                <p>I think that the way that one wins this game is by going extremely slowly and collaborating on every step with every player and by having however many players who are experienced in the game.</p>
                <p>I think it, I think it requires all of those things. Well, maybe not the experience component that that's just another slow down. If you don't have that, it's going to take a long time to get everyone ramped up. ⁓ but I really think it's like each individual decision. the, the sequencing matters so much here. what order you do things in matters if you do something before someone else needs it, you know, it's like there's, there's.</p>
                <p>There's opportunities to optimize every little individual tiny move in this game. ⁓ And so that coordination, think, is probably, unless you get very, very lucky on cards, it probably requires just very careful consideration and coordination.</p>

                <p>If you were playing it in person, there's some physical components that would actually help a little bit to make things more clear. Whereas the digital versions of them, you have to notice that that's there and like, that's what that is.</p>

                <p>I think in closing, It's really amazing at teaching some of these climate ideas. It's got some amazing game mechanics.</p>
                <p>It is very hard, but it's fun. The engine building, the mechanics in how the card stacks work and the different symbols interact with each other and the different game flows, feedback with each other is really neat. It's a genuinely fun game, even if it's difficult</p>

                <p>I'm really curious just about the actual game design mechanics of making this game easier and harder. There's both. The other thing that I think is really fascinating, we talked a little bit about Go last time.</p>
                <p>One of the things I have always deeply loved about Go is that you can have a very even game between a great player and an OK player. There's a balance mechanic that evolved, which is just fascinating. This has the same thing. The easy, standard, and difficult setting can be set for the entire game, but you can also do it per player. So you could actually have a thing where you've got two experienced players playing normally.</p>

                <p>And then you could put three players, two players, in easy mode, which is really interesting. For playing with people that haven't done it much before, and family and stuff, in the service of getting people to learn about climate stuff, supporting having experienced players play with newbies and have it be fun for everybody is a really big feature. So that per player difficulty is fascinating. I would love to explore that. Yeah, it's a great call out.</p>

                <p>so so I think winning might be possible, but it takes a long time. And a lot of luck.</p>
