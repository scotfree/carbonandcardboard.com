        <h2>AI Summary</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Carbon and Cardboard - Episode 1</strong> is a conversation exploring whether board games can effectively communicate ideas relevant to understanding the climate crisis. The five participants—Scot Free Kennedy (host), Joshua, Audrey Woodward, Laura, and Nathaniel Granor—all share backgrounds in tech, education, and environmental advocacy, along with a passion for board games. They bring diverse perspectives on game design, climate education, and how games can serve as teaching tools for complex concepts.</p>
        
        <p>The discussion covers several key ideas about learning through games, including the challenge of "transfer" (applying skills learned in one context to another), the distinction between thematic learning (content about a topic) and strategic learning (meta-game skills), and multimodal learning approaches. Core climate-relevant concepts emerge as priorities: exponential and compounded growth, systems thinking and interconnected effects, the value of time and opportunity costs, feedback loops, asymmetry in goals and power, and understanding that all actions have environmental consequences. The group explores how cooperation versus competition mechanics can model climate challenges, and discusses the importance of metacognition and post-game reflection to deepen learning.</p>
        
        <p>Games discussed range from gateway classics to specialized titles: <strong>Settlers of Catan</strong> (resource management), <strong>Daybreak</strong> (explicitly climate-themed cooperative game), <strong>Wingspan</strong> (bird ecology), <strong>Root</strong> (asymmetric gameplay), <strong>Dead of Winter</strong> (cooperative with individual goals), <strong>Chicago Express</strong> (auctioning and economics), <strong>New Bedford</strong> (whaling and resource depletion), <strong>Sushi Go</strong> (expected value calculations), <strong>Go</strong> (emergent complexity), <strong>Solutions</strong> (climate education card game), <strong>Terra Mystica</strong> (asymmetric factions), <strong>Sky Team</strong> (scenario-based cooperative), <strong>Stocks and Bonds</strong> (authentic financial modeling), <strong>Brass Birmingham</strong> (economic balance), and video games <strong>Factorio</strong> (pollution consequences) and various RPGs like <strong>The Witcher</strong> (cascading decision effects).</p>
